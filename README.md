# How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Volatility Curve

This is a series of blog posts that I composed in the winter of the year 2023 / 2024. Please don't take any of the information as absolute facts. I am still learning, if you think there is a mistake then you are probably right. The purpose behind this posts is to clarify some stuff about option theory and also to force myself to write down some things that I learned.

* [Kurtosis](kurtosis/kurtosis.md)
