# Blog

This is a series of blog posts that I composed in the winter of the year 2023 / 2024. Please don't take any of the information as financial advice, nor as absolute facts. The purpose behind this posts is to clarify some stuff about option theory and also to force myself to write down some things that I learned. If you think that there are any mistakes, please tell me. There will be many.
